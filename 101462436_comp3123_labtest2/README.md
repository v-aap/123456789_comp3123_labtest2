# Valeria's Weather App

Valeria's Weather App is a modern React application that allows users to view real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays essential weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a dynamic weather icon representing the current condition.
